msgid "A method for discovering a Device to Device (D2D) device, comprising:determining, by a source D2D device, whether there is network coverage;when there is the network coverage, sending, by the source D2D device, a request to discover one or more proximity D2D devices, receiving wireless resource information, sending announcement information according to the wireless resource information and monitoring response information; andwhen there is no network coverage, sending, by the source D2D device, announcement information according to the wireless resource information preconfigured in the source D2D device and monitoring response information."

msgid "The D2D communication includes two aspects: discovery and communication.  As for the scene of network coverage, the process is generally implemented by a control plane managing D2D at the network side. As for the scene of no network coverage, the control plane process is generally implemented by the D2D device itself. However, present technologies cannot provide a method for discovery between D2D devices."

msgid "In view of this, the disclosure is intended to provide a method, an apparatus and a system for discovering a D2D device, which can realize discovery between D2D devices, reduce the power consumption of D2D device and improve the discovery efficiency of D2D device."
