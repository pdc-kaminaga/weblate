"A method for discovering a Device to Device (D2D) device, comprising:"
"determining, by a source D2D device, whether there is network coverage;when "
"there is the network coverage, sending, by the source D2D device, a request "
"to discover one or more proximity D2D devices, receiving wireless resource "
"information, sending announcement information according to the wireless "
"resource information and monitoring response information; andwhen there is "
"no network coverage, sending, by the source D2D device, announcement "
"information according to the wireless resource information preconfigured in "
"the source D2D device and monitoring response information."

"The D2D communication includes two aspects: discovery and communication.  As "
"for the scene of network coverage, the process is generally implemented by a "
"control plane managing D2D at the network side. As for the scene of no "
"network coverage, the control plane process is generally implemented by the "
"D2D device itself. However, present technologies cannot provide a method for "
"discovery between D2D devices."

"In view of this, the disclosure is intended to provide a method, an "
"apparatus and a system for discovering a D2D device, which can realize "
"discovery between D2D devices, reduce the power consumption of D2D device "
"and improve the discovery efficiency of D2D device."
