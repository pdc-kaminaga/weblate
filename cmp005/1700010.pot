"</figref> shows a greenhouse designated with 100, in which plant cultivation "
"roofing 10 in the form of film material is used for the roof and walls of "
"the greenhouse 100. Inside the greenhouse 100 there are plants 20, which are "
"being grown in the greenhouse 100. As indicated by arrows, UV radiation as "
"well as PAR radiation and IR radiation strike the roofing 10 as total "
"radiation primarily from above, depending on the position of the sun. "
"<honyaku_sentence_del>A portion of the incident radiation from the outside "
"is always reflected, another portion is absorbed by the film, i.e., the "
"material of the roofing 10, and still another portion is let through or "
"rather transmitted. With the transmitted radiation, a distinction is made "
"between direct radiation and radiation converted into diffuse light by "
"refraction. The UV radiation is partially retained by the film material. The "
"infrared radiation is partially transmitted. It is absorbed by the soil and "
"slowly released back into the surroundings.</honyaku_sentence_del><p></p>"

"[0071] <honyaku_sentence_del>In the ON mode of the novel film, considerably "
"less near infrared is transmitted than in the OFF mode, which owing to the "
"higher temperature level during the ON mode is also desirable. "
"</honyaku_sentence_del>By comparison the whitewashed standard film "
"illustrated in the bottom right of <figref idref=\"\"DRAWINGS\"\"><font "
"style=\"\"font-weight: bold;\"\" color=\"\"brown\"\">FIG. 3</font></figref> "
"only allows 30% of the PAR spectrum to reach the crop because 70% of the "
"incident light is reflected. In this example, lime was applied at the rate "
"of 75 g/m<sup>2</sup>. <honyaku_sentence_del>In spite of the high degree of "
"reflection, the proportion of diffuse light is less than with the "
"thermotropic film of the invention. 6%, i.e., ca. 20% of the transmitted "
"light, is still in the form of direct radiation. Whitewashing acts on the "
"light incidence side. This explains the high degree of reflection and the "
"low level of near infrared transmission. This shows that lime can be applied "
"to the film of the invention as an additional measure during particularly "
"hot periods and thus makes it possible to exclude radiation altogether, "
"including thermal radiation.</honyaku_sentence_del><p></p>"

"color=\"\"brown\"\">FIG. 4</font></figref> shows an experiment with a film "
"of the invention on a chamber. The PAR radiation transmission is plotted "
"against the air temperature. The lower switching temperature of the "
"switching interval T<sub>a </sub>to T<sub>b </sub>is between 26 and 28° C. "
"The switching interval ends at T<sub>b≃</sub>42° C. <honyaku_sentence_del>As "
"can be discerned, the switching stroke is distributed over the switching "
"interval and transmission becomes less and less as the temperature rises. In "
"this manner optimum use can be made of the PAR radiation essential to the "
"plant. Transmission only decreases by ca. 15%. Nevertheless effective "
"protection is ensured at high temperatures.</honyaku_sentence_del><p></p>"
