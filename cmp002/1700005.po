msgid "FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the towing assembly."
msgstr ""
msgid "The towing assembly 1 comprises two straps&#x2014;a recovery strap 2 and a diffuser strap 4&#x2014;both of which at their ends include fastening elements. The fastening elements allow connection of the straps to the connecting element of each vehicle. Separate fastening of the recovery strap and the diffuser strap to the connecting elements ensures that the diffuser strap will remain securely fastened between the tow vehicle and the vehicle being towed when the recovery strap fails. As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, the diffuser strap 4 may be longer than the recovery strap 2, and further may comprise at least two sleeves 6 disposed along the length of the diffuser strap 4. As shown in FIG. 4, the diffuser strap 4 may be the same length or approximately the same length as the recovery strap 2. During the towing operation, the diffuser strap 4 is subject to no, or minimal (compared to the towing forces on the recovery strap), towing forces and remains intact when the recovery strap fails. Each sleeve disposed along the length of the diffuser strap 4 absorbs energy that is released when the recovery strap fails, and these sleeves collectively, with the diffuser strap, absorb and diffuse the kinetic and potential energy released from the failure of the recovery strap. Thus, by slowing down the high velocity recovery strap, and by restraining its movement, the diffuser strap prevents adjacent property from being damaged or persons from being injured."
