msgid "In U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014/0030187, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, Weichert et al. disclose using analogs of the base compound 18-(p-iodophenyl)octadecyl phosphcholine (CLR1404; see FIG. 1) for detecting and locating, as well as for treating, solid tumor cancers. For example, if the iodo moiety is an imaging-optimized radionucleide, such as iodine-124 ([124I]-CLR1404), the analog can be used in positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of solid tumors, or in other imaging/detection applications. Alternatively, if the iodo moiety is a radionuclide optimized for delivering therapeutic doses of radiation to the solid tumors cells in which the analog is taken up, such as iodine-125 or iodine-131 ([125I]-CLR1404 or [131]-CLR1404), the analog can be used to treat the solid tumors."

msgid "In U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010/0284929, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, Pinchuk et al. extend this idea to the visual detection of solid tumors. Specifically, Pinchuk et al. disclose further analogs of CLR1404, wherein the iodo moiety is substituted with a fluorophore. For example, if the iodo moiety is substituted with a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene), the resulting compound (CLR1501; see FIG. 2) is taken up by solid tumor cells, which can then be visually detected/imaged. CLR1404 analogs having other fluorphores substituted for the iodo moiety, such as IR-775 (CLR1502; see FIG. 3), can similarly be used to visually identify/detect solid tumors or cells from non-solid tumors."

msgid "The invention relates to a towing assembly that is used in towing operations to avoid damage to injury or persons when a soft tow apparatus, such as a tow strap, tow rope, or cable, fails during vehicle recovery operations. The assembly comprises: (a) a recovery strap that can be connected to a towing vehicle and a vehicle to be towed; (b) a diffuser strap that can be connected to Ca towing vehicle and a vehicle to be towed and (c) two or more sleeves disposed on the diffuser strap. The diffuser strap captures and dissipates the kinetic and potential energy that is released when the recovery strap when it breaks."
